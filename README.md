# "9095"

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/9095/blob/main/9095_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming (recurrence relation)

## What was the key point and the hard part?
 
The numbers that I can use is just 1, 2 and 3, so I think about that the number 'n' can be made from (n-3+3) , (n-2+2) , (n-1+1). 
I write down the possible cases, and then I notice that there is a pattern.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
Thank you for visiting this github!
